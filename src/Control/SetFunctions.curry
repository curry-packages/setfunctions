--- This module contains an implementation of set functions.
--- The general idea of set functions is described in:

---
--- Intuition: If `f` is an n-ary function, then `(setn f)` is a set-valued
--- function that collects all non-determinism caused by f (but not
--- the non-determinism caused by evaluating arguments!) in a set.
--- Thus, `(setn f a1 ... an)` returns the set of all
--- values of `(f b1 ... bn)` where `b1`,...,`bn` are values
--- of the arguments `a1`,...,`an` (i.e., the arguments are
--- evaluated "outside" this capsule so that the non-determinism
--- caused by evaluating these arguments is not captured in this capsule
--- but yields several results for `(setn...)`.
--- Similarly, logical variables occuring in `a1`,...,`an` are not bound
--- inside this capsule (in PAKCS they cause a suspension until
--- they are bound).
---
--- The set of values returned by a set function is represented
--- by an abstract type 'Values' on which several operations are
--- defined in this module. Actually, it is a multiset of values,
--- i.e., duplicates are not removed.
---
--- The handling of failures and nested occurrences of set functions
--- is not specified in the previous paper. Thus, a detailed description
--- of the semantics of set functions as implemented in this library
--- can be found in the paper

---
--- Restrictions of the PAKCS implementation of set functions:
--- 
--- 1. The set is a multiset, i.e., it might contain multiple values.
--- 2. The multiset of values is completely evaluated when demanded.
---    Thus, if it is infinite, its evaluation will not terminate
---    even if only some elements (e.g., for a containment test)
---    are demanded. However, for the emptiness test, at most one
---    value will be computed
--- 3. The arguments of a set function are strictly evaluated before
---    the set functions itself will be evaluated.
--- 4. If the multiset of values contains unbound variables,
---    the evaluation suspends.
